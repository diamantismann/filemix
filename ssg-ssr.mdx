You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

```ts
const sum = (num1: number, num2: number): number => {
  return num1 + num2;
};

console.log(sum(10, 20)); // 30
```

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static
Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page
shows • frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every
request.

In that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip
pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.
